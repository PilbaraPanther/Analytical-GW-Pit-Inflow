# Analytical-GW-Pit-Inflow
Pit inflow program (Marinelli &amp; Niccoli, 1998) This program simulates pit into a rectangular area. It first calculates an effect (circular) radius of a rectangle (length x width) The radius of influence is then calculated (Niccoli et al, 1998) Flow into the pit is then calculated (Marinelli and Niccoli, 1998)
